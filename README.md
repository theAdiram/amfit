Home Workout Planner – Your Personal Fitness Coach at Home
No gym? No problem. This app is all you need.

The Home Workout Planner creates a personalized fitness plan just for you—no equipment needed. Whether your goal is to lose weight, build muscle, or stay active, the app builds a routine that fits your body, schedule, and lifestyle.

🔍 What Makes It Special?
1. Smart Personalization
We don’t give random workouts. You’ll fill a quick profile (age, body stats, fitness goals, time available, injuries, and preferences), and the app creates a plan tailored just for you.

2. Equipment-Free Routines
Every workout is designed to be done at home, with no equipment. From beginners to pros, we adjust the difficulty as you progress.

3. Real-Time Guided Workouts
You’ll get timers, voice guidance, and step-by-step video demos for every move. It’s like having a personal trainer in your pocket.

4. Track Your Progress
Log workouts, track your body changes, and see how far you’ve come. The app keeps evolving your workouts as you grow stronger.

5. Stay Motivated
Unlock achievements, hit weekly targets, and stay on track with regular progress check-ins.
